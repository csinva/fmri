      "<Mel Dorado>: Tonight on the Mel Dorado Show. His story gripped the world. Oil billionaire Miles Axlerod an attempt to become the first car to circumnavigate the globe without GPS ironically ran out of gas and found himself trapped in the wild. Feared dead he emerged thirty six days later running on a fuel he distilled himself from the natural elements. Since then he's sold his oil fortune converted himself from a gas guzzler into an electric car and has devoted his life to finding a renewable clean burning fuel. Now he claims to have done it with his Allinol. And to show the world what his new super fuel can do He's created a racing competition like no other inviting the greatest champions from around the globe to battle in the first ever World Grand Prix. Welcome Sir Miles Axlerod. \n",
      "<Miles Axlerod>: Thank you Mel. it is very very good to be here. Now listen to me. Big oil. It costs a fortune. Pollution is getting worse. I mean come on. It's a fossil fuel. Fossil as in dead dinosaurs. And we all know what happened to them. Alternative energy is the future. \n",
      "<Mater>: What happened to the dinosaurs now. \n",
      "<Mel Dorado>: And on satellite a World Grand Prix competitor and one of the fastest cars in the world Francesco Bernoulli. \n",
      "<Francesco Bernoulli>: It is an honor Signore Dorado for you. \n",
      "<Mel Dorado>: Miles why not invite Lightning McQueen? \n",
      "<Miles Axlerod>: Of course we invited him. \n",
      "<Mater>: What? \n",
      "<Miles Axlerod>: But apparently after his very long racing season he is taking some time off to rest. \n",
      "<Francesco Bernoulli>: The Lightning McQueen would not have a chance against Francesco. \n",
      "<Mel Dorado>: Let's go to the phones. Baltimore Maryland you're on the air. \n",
      "<caller>: Am I on? Hello. \n",
      "<Mel Dorado>: You're on. Go ahead. \n",
      "<caller>: Hello. \n",
      "<Mel Dorado>: Go ahead caller. \n",
      "<caller>: Hello. \n",
      "<Mel Dorado>: Let's go to Radiator Springs. You're on caller. \n",
      "<Mater>: Yeah. That Italian feller you got on there can't talk that way about Lightning McQueen. He's the bestest race car in the whole wide world. \n",
      "<Francesco Bernoulli>: If he is how you say the bestest race car then why must he rest? \n",
      "<Mater>: ' cause he knows what's important. Every now and then he prefers just to slow down enjoy life. \n",
      "<Francesco Bernoulli>: You heard it. Lightning McQueen prefers to be slow. Of course this is not news to Francesco. When I want to go to sleep I watch one of his races. After two laps I am out cold. \n",
      "<Mater>: That ain't what I meant. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Hey what's going on over there. \n",
      "<Francesco Bernoulli>: He is afraid of Francesco. This is. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: That's that Italian formula car. His name is... \n",
      "<Sally>: Francesco Bernoulli. No wonder there's a crowd. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: W-why do you know his name? And don't say it like that. It's three syllables not ten. \n",
      "<Sally>: What? He's nice to look at. you know open wheeled and all. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: What's wrong with fenders? \n",
      "<Sally>: Nothing. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: I thought you liked my fenders. \n",
      "<Mater>: Well let me tell you something else there Mr San Francisco. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Mater. \n",
      "<Mater>: McQueen could drive circles around you. \n",
      "<Francesco Bernoulli>: Driving in a circle is all he cana do no. \n",
      "<Mater>: No. I mean yes. I mean He could beat you anywhere Any time any track. \n",
      "<Francesco Bernoulli>: Mel can we move on? Francesco needs a caller who can provide a little more intellectual stimulation like a dump truck. \n",
      "<Mater>: That shows what you know. Dump trucks is dumb. Hey. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Yeah hi. This is Lightning McQueen. \n",
      "<Francesco Bernoulli>: The Lightning McQueen. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Look I don't appreciate my best friend being insulted like that. \n",
      "<Francesco Bernoulli>: McQueen. That was your best friend? This is the difference between you and Francesco. Francesco knows how good he is. He does not need to surround himself with tow trucks to prove it. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: T-Those are strong words from a car that is so fragile. \n",
      "<Francesco Bernoulli>: Fragile. He calls-a Francesco fragile? Not-a so fast McQueen. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Not so fast. What is that your new motto? \n",
      "<Francesco Bernoulli>: Motto? \n",
      "<Miles Axlerod>: Wow. This sounds like something that needs to be settled on the race course. What do you say Lightning McQueen? We've still got room for one more racer. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Well I would love to. The only thing is my crew is off for the season so... \n",
      "<Guido>: Pit stop. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: You know what? They just got back. Deal me in baby. Ka-chow. I know I know. I just got back but we won't be long. \n",
      "<Sally>: No don't worry about me. I mean I've got enough to do here. Mater's gon na have a blast though. You're bringing Mater right? You never bring him to any of your races. Just let him sit in the pits. Give him a headset. Come on it'll be the thrill of a lifetime for him. \n",
      "<Mater>: Your drink sir. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Mater. \n",
      "<Mater>: I didn't taste it. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: How'd you like to come and see the world with me. \n",
      "<Mater>: You mean it? \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Yeah. You got me into this thing. You're coming along. \n",
      "<Mater>: All right. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Ka-chow. Hey. \n",
      "<Luigi>: Guido L-look. Ferraris and tires. Let's go. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Look at this. Okay now. Mater. Remember best behavior. \n",
      "<Mater>: You got it buddy. Hey what's that? \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Mater. \n",
      "<Lewis Hamilton>: Hey McQueen. Over here. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Lewis. Hey man. Jeff. \n",
      "<Jeff Gorvette>: Hey Lightning. Can you believe this party? \n",
      "<Mater>: Hey. You done good. You got all the leaves. \n",
      "<Jeff Gorvette>: Check out that tow truck. \n",
      "<Lewis Hamilton>: Man I wonder who that guy's with. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: W-will you guys excuse me just for one little second? \n",
      "<Mater>: Good job. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Mater. Listen. Th-this isn't Radiator Springs. \n",
      "<Mater>: You're just realizing that? That jet lag really done a number. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Mater look. Things are different over here. Which means maybe you should you know act a little different too. \n",
      "<Mater>: Different than what? \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Well just help me out here buddy. I... \n",
      "<Mater>: You need help? Shoot. Why didn't you just say so? That's what a tow truck does. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Yeah. \n",
      "<Mater>: Hey looky there it's Mister San Francisco. I'll introduce you. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Mater no. \n",
      "<Mater>: Look at me. I'm helping you already. Hey Mister San Francisco I'd like you to meet. \n",
      "<Francesco Bernoulli>: Lightning McQueen. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Um nice to meet you Francesco. \n",
      "<Francesco Bernoulli>: Nice to meet you too. You're very good looking. Not as good as I thought but you're good. \n",
      "<Mater>: Excuse me. Can I get a picture with you? \n",
      "<Francesco Bernoulli>: Anything for McQueen's friend. \n",
      "<Mater>: Miss Sally is going to flip when she sees this. She's Lightning McQueen's girlfriend. \n",
      "<Francesco Bernoulli>: Ooh... \n",
      "<Mater>: She's a big fan of yours. \n",
      "<Francesco Bernoulli>: Hey she has-a good taste. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Mater's prone to exaggeration. I wouldn't say she's a big fan. \n",
      "<Mater>: You're right. She's a huge fan. She goes on and on about your open wheels here. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Well mentioning it once doesn't qualify as going on and on. \n",
      "<Francesco Bernoulli>: Francesco is-a familiar with this reaction to Francesco. Women respect a car that has-a nothing to hide. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Yeah uh. \n",
      "<Francesco Bernoulli>: Let us have a toast. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Let's. \n",
      "<Francesco Bernoulli>: I dedicate my win tomorrow to Miss Sally. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Sorry. I already dedicated my win tomorrow to her. So if we both do it it's really not so special. Besides I don't have a drink. \n",
      "<Mater>: Well I'll get one. Hey you mind if I borrow a few bucks for one of them drinks? \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: They're free Mater. \n",
      "<Mater>: Free? Well shoot what am I doing here? \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: You know I I should probably go keep an eye on him. See you at the race. \n",
      "<Francesco Bernoulli>: Yes you will see Francesco but not like this. You will see him like this as he drives away from you. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: That's cute. So you had one of those made up for all the racers? \n",
      "<Francesco Bernoulli>: No. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Okay. \n",
      "<Francesco Bernoulli>: Ciao McQueen. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: He is so getting beat tomorrow. \n",
      "<announcer>: Ladies and gentle cars. Sir Miles Axlelrod. \n",
      "<Miles Axlerod>: It is my absolute honor to introduce to you the competitors in the first ever World Grand Prix. From Brazil number eight. \n",
      "<Holly Shiftwell>: Oh hello. \n",
      "<Finn McMissile>: Hello. \n",
      "<Holly Shiftwell>: A Volkswagon Karmann Gia has no radiator. \n",
      "<Finn McMissile>: That's because it's air cooled. \n",
      "<Holly Shiftwell>: Great. I'm Agent Shiftwell Holley Shiftwell from the Tokyo station. I have a message from London. \n",
      "<Finn McMissile>: Not here. You must try the canapes on the mezzanine. So the lab boys analyzed the photo I sent. What did they learn about the camera? \n",
      "<Holly Shiftwell>: It appears to be a standard television camera. They said if you could get closer photos next time that would be great. \n",
      "<Finn McMissile>: This was London's message? \n",
      "<Holly Shiftwell>: Oh no no. No sir. Uhm... The oil platforms you were on. Turns out they're sitting on the biggest oil reserve in the world. \n",
      "<Finn McMissile>: How did we miss that? \n",
      "<Holly Shiftwell>: They've been scrambling everyone's satellites. The Americans actually discovered it just before you did. They placed an agent on that platform under deep cover. He was able to get a photo of the car who's running the entire operation. \n",
      "<Finn McMissile>: Great. Well who is it? Has anyone seen the photo yet? \n",
      "<Holly Shiftwell>: Nope not yet. The American is here tonight to pass it to you. He'll signal you when he's ready. \n",
      "<Finn McMissile>: Good good. Oh no. \n",
      "<Holly Shiftwell>: What is it? \n",
      "<Finn McMissile>: Change of plan. You're meeting the American. \n",
      "<Holly Shiftwell>: What? Me? \n",
      "<Finn McMissile>: Those thugs down there were on the oil platform. If they see me the whole mission is compromised. \n",
      "<Holly Shiftwell>: No no. I'm technical you see. I'm in diagnostics. I'm I'm not a field agent. \n",
      "<Finn McMissile>: You are now. \n",
      "<Mater>: I'll take one of them. Thank you. Never know which one McQueen will have a hankering for. Hey what you got here that's free? How ' bout that pistachio ice cream? \n",
      "<sushi chef>: No no. Wasabi. \n",
      "<Mater>: Oh same old same old. What's up with you? That looks delicious. Little more please. It is free right? Keep it coming. Little more. Come on let's go. It's free. You're getting there. Scoop scoop. There ya go. Now that's a scoop of ice cream. \n",
      "<Miles Axlerod>: And now our last competitor. Number ninety five Lightning McQueen. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Ka-chow. Thank you so much for having us Sir Axlerod. I really look forward to racing. This is a great opportunity. \n",
      "<Miles Axlerod>: The pleasure is all ours Lightning. You and your team bring excellence and professionalism to this competition. \n",
      "<Mater>: Somebody get me water. Sweet relief. Whatever you do do not eat the free pistachio ice cream. It has turned. \n",
      "<Lightning McQueen>: Sir Axlerod I can explain. This is Mater. He's... \n",
      "<Miles Axlerod>: No I know him.\n"
